# Musculoskeletal Abnormalities Detection by Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to detect abnormalities in X-ray images of various body parts such as the wrist, finger, humerus, forearm, and hand. The application is built using **Flask** and leverages TensorFlow/Keras for model inference.

## Features
- **X-ray Image Analysis:** Upload X-ray images and get predictions for abnormalities.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Models trained for detecting abnormalities in:
  - Wrist (XR_WRIST)
  - Finger (XR_FINGER)
  - Humerus (XR_HUMERUS)
  - Forearm (XR_FOREARM)
  - Hand (XR_HAND)
- **Confidence Score:** Each prediction is accompanied by a confidence level.
